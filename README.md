To install this mod:
1) Add the Meshes folder to your Fallout 4/Data directory.
2) Modify your fallout4.ini file (found Documents/My Games/Fallout 4) so that sResourceDataDirsFinal has a Meshes\ tag on the end. For example: sResourceDataDirsFinal=Meshes\

Known Issues:
Whilst the asset swap works perfectly for the occasions where Baby.nif is used, when Shaun is being carried there is a lot of clipping through either Nate or Nora. 
When the events occur in the vault the asset swapped model for Shaun is invisible. This may be because when shaun is being carried he is seen in the game as a pip-boy and
my asset swap currently is not.

To implement:
Replace all of Shaun's dialogue with that of Liberty Prime.

Notes:
This mod is not a serious mod. It was something I did for fun to learn about asset swapping in the engine and the limitations that occur.
